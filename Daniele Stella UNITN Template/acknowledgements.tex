\emph{
I would like to extend my profound gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Kasim Sinan Yildirim, for his unwavering guidance, expertise, and encouragement throughout the course of my research. His insights have been pivotal in shaping the trajectory of my work.}
\emph{My appreciation further extends to Prof. Gian Pietro Picco, Dr. Davide Vecchia, and Dr. Matteo Trobinger. Their insightful discussions, suggestions, and feedback have undoubtedly enriched my understanding and inspired me to explore new avenues.}
\emph{I also wish to convey my heartfelt thanks to Christian Sassi, Davide Molteni, the University of Trento, and everyone else who provided invaluable support, creating an environment that championed both teamwork and individual academic pursuits.}

\emph{My research journey also involved collaborative efforts with Christian Sassi. As research interns at the University of Trento, Christian and I jointly undertook the comprehensive characterization of the Spark SR1020 Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radios, examining their performance metrics in depth. In light of this collaboration, and in the spirit of academic integrity and transparency, we wish to highlight the following:

    \item \textit{Our combined efforts are reflected in shared content, including but not limited to testing protocols, environmental conditions, empirical data, and initial conclusions.}
    \item \textit{Despite this shared foundation, our respective theses stand as distinct and independent works, each with its unique research focus. While I, Daniele Stella, explore the intricacies of power consumption, Christian zeroes in on latency testing and data rate evaluations. Our shared test results from the range evaluation are approached differently in line with our individual research objectives.}
    \item \textit{We have ensured that all overlapping content is aptly credited and referenced, acknowledging our collaborative endeavors.}
